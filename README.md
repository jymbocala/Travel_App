## Project Description

Extracting data sources from multiple APIs, this is a dynamic travel weather planning application that helps people plan trips by generating weather forecasts for the places they’re visiting.

This project aimed to give me the opportunity to put all of the skills I have learned into one project to build my own custom travel app. I will be targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Also, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.


## Questions I encountered

The following are just some of the questions that I've experienced along the way:

- What’s the ideal workflow?
- How many files do I need?
- How do I convert one project into another?
- Should I redo the HTML/CSS first or go straight to the javascript?
- How many JavaScript functions do I need?
- Should my function be this many lines of code?
- Is readability or performance more important?
